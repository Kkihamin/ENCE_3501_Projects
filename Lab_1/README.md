## HandCalculations

  1. This is the image of the 5 bit DAC used to calculate the output resistance below.
     ![output resistance for DAC](https://github.com/Kkihamin/ENCE_3501_Projects/assets/129350322/86b7a7d6-bf25-4649-9bf1-e70af1053feb)
     
Figure 1: The output resistance calculation of the 5 bit DAC

The output resistance came out to be 10kohms.

2. This is the image of the hand calculations of the delay if a 5 bit DAC has a 10pF capacitator load below.

Figure 2: The delay of the 5 bit DAC with 10pF capacitator load 

Based on Figure 2 above I did 0.7*(10 X 10^3)*(10 X 10^-12) = 70ns

3. Figure 3 below shows the delay I got on the simulation through LtSpice

   Figure 3: Delay of 70ns shown in the simulation

4. The image below shows the simulation of the 5 bit DAC with a 10k load resistor at 2 volts.

   I noticed as the voltage I input increased the voltage output increased and the current decreased. For example, at 1v the current was 50uA but at 2V the current went down to 100uA of current.
