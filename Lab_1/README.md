## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
1. The objective of the DAC was to initially use the R_Divider schematic for a portion of the 5-bit DAC and then use that to implement the 5-bit DAC. The 5-bit DAC is simulated on LTSpice and created on ElectricVLSI to observe and simulate a simple DAC. This simple 5-bit DAC will be implemented in future labs.

## Hand Calculations <a name="HandCalculations"></a>
The hand calculations needed were the output resistance, the delay with the 10pF capacitor, and the 10k load resistance DAC. The output resistance, delay with the 10pF load, and the 10k load resistance are shown in the figures in the subheaders below.

### Output Resistance <a name="OutputResistance"></a>
The output resistance calculation of the 5-bit DAC when all the inputs are grounded and the DAC does not have any capacitor or resistor load is 10kÎ© and is shown in Figure 1 below.

### delay with the 10pF capacitator load <a name="delay with the 10pF capacitator load"></a>
1. The delay of the 5-bit DAC with a 10pF capacitator load is calculated by delay = 0.7 * (10 * 10^3) * (10 * 10^-12) = 70ns as shown in Figure 2 below.

### Load of 10k resistor DAC <a name="Load of 10k resistor DAC"></a>
1. The effect of the load of 10k resistor on the DAC is calculated by doing the Thevenin theorem at the input voltage as 2V and applied ohm's law to get 100UA which is what I got for the simulation as well and it is shown in Figure 3 below.
