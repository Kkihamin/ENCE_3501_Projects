 ## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
    1. The objective of this lab was to create a Padframe for the DAC that I created from lab 1 with slight edits to the layout of the DAC because the DAC from lab 1 was not laid out in the correct way.
## Schematics <a name="Schematics"></a>
   1. This section covers the schematics of the DAC, padframe, and the DAC with the Padframe.
## Pad frame <a name="Pad frame"></a>
   1. Figure 1 below shows the Padframe schematic created from dragging in the pad cell icon.

## Padframe <a name="Padframe"></a>
   1. Figure 5 below shows the layout of the Padframe created from making a 4 by 4 array of the layout of the pad.
