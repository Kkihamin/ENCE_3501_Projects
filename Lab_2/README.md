 ## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
 1. The objective of this lab was to create a Padframe for the DAC that I created from lab 1 with slight edits to the layout of the DAC because the DAC from lab 1 was not laid out in the correct way.
## Schematics <a name="Schematics"></a>
1. This section covers the schematics of the DAC, padframe, and the DAC with the Padframe.
